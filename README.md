> Detect cosmic ray using bad code. Not suggested for practical use.

### What are Cosmic Rays? ☀️
Cosmic rays are **high-energy protons and atomic nuclei that move through space at nearly the speed of light**. They originate from the Sun, from outside of the Solar System in our own galaxy, and from distant galaxies.

### How are the Rays detected? 🕵️‍♀️
Very simple. We store a value in the memory of the computer's memory and then we wait until a comsic ray hits the PC and changes the value with a bitflip. Code checks for the change and tells if something has happened or not. This method is really shitty but in theory it should work.
